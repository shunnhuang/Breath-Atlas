# 🌬️ Breath Atlas: Mapping the Underground Breath of London

**Breath Atlas** is a hybrid research-visualization project that explores the relationship between movement, air quality, and infrastructure within the London Underground. By combining real-world data, structural analysis, and environmental mapping, the project reveals the hidden respiratory logic beneath the city.

## 🧭 Project Structure

This project unfolds in **two interlinked phases**:

### 1. Breath & Move
This stage investigates how airflow, human flow, and space co-exist underground.
- PM2.5 and NO₂ concentrations across different lines and stations  
- Crowd dynamics, congestion hotspots, and ventilation behavior  
- On-site photography from the London Transport Museum and public spaces

### 2. Atlas Mapping
The second phase visualizes the hidden systems that shape urban breath.
- Earth Engine analysis of NO₂ overlays vs. PTAL accessibility maps  
- Procurement history of underground components (2009–2018)  
- 3D schematics of tunnels, ventilation shafts, and air systems  
- Electron microscope imagery of PM2.5 particles from tube air

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- “Google Earth Engine” – pollution data & spatial overlays  
- "Python / Pandas / Jupyter" – data processing & visualization  
- "Blender" – 3D modeling of ventilation and tunnels  
- "Adobe Suite" – design, animation, and narrative composition

## 🔗 Data Sources

- **Transport for London (TfL)**: Engineering drawings, standards, contracts  
- **DEFRA & LAEI**: NO₂ and PM2.5 public data  
- **European Procurement Records (2009–2018)**  
- **Academic studies**: Cambridge & Imperial College on tube air composition  

## 📸 Visual Assets

- Microscopy images of magnetite-rich PM2.5 particles  
- Annotated photos of ventilation shafts, fan systems, and track beds  
- Maps showing spatial correlation between NO₂ and urban transit access  

## 🎯 Key Questions

- How does London breathe underground?
- What can air tell us about urban infrastructure, movement, and inequality?
- How did EU-era procurement shape today's underground space?
